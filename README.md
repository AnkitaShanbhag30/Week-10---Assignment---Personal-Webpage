Welcome to my personal portfolio! This is a work in progress, and any feedback will be appreciated.

I used a Bootstrap template from [Start Bootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com/theme/grayscale) to create my portfolio. I worked on the projects listed in the [Projects](./projects.html) page as part of [MIT xPRO Bootcamp - Women's Cohort](https://xpro.mit.edu/).

You can navigate between my [Projects](./projects.html) and [About Me](./index.html) to learn more about me and my work.

3. Edit [config.js.example](./config.js.example), and replace `ADD-YOUR-MAPBOX-ACCESS-TOKEN-HERE` with your MapBox access token.
4. Rename [config.js.example](./config.js.example) to config.js
